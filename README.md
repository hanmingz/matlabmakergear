Use this code at your own risk!

This script uses matlab to read gcode from a txt file and sends command to makergear M2 3D printer. The gcode can be handwritten or generated by another slicer software. Matlab interacts with makergear via serial communication. You will need to change the serial port at the begining of the readtxtandsend main script to your cooresponding printer. It then reads the gcode line by line and send command to printer. It will send the next line once it receives ok echo from last line. Currently, there's no way to stop in midway, but modifications in progress.

The listen function listens to echo from printer until there are no more.

The removecomment function removes all comments from commands.
